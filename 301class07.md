## Reading for class 07

This topic is important because API's are one of the may ways we can get information from other sources very efficiently.  Understanding the basics of REST is also important because it will allows us to understand the structure of the API's we use.  API's are used a lot in the industry and understanding how they work will help us to be more efficient in our work.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**

    - Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet, and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

    - Because they weren't designed to be used like that. They were designed for a very specific use case only work with a small number of machines.  Today, we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world. HTTP allows us to talk to machines anywhere in the world.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

    - HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns.  The nouns are things like people, places, and things.  The verbs are things like get, post, put, and delete.  The nouns are the resources and the verbs are the actions that we want to perform on those resources.

4. **What does a GET do?**

    - GET is used to retrieve information from a server using a URL. It is the most common HTTP verb.

5. **What does a POST do?**

    - POST is used to send data to a server to modify/update a resource.

6. **What does PUT do?**

    - PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

7. **What does PATCH do?**

    - PATCH is used to send data to a server to modify/update a resource where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.
