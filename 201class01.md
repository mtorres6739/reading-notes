# Code 201: Class 1 Reading Notes

## Pre-work for Class 1

### Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

    > The client starts first, it begins with a request;\
    the server receives, and responds in jest;\
    once the circle's complete, the whole picture is seen,\
    what you have just witnessed, is HTTP on your screen.
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

    > HTML is the first language to get parsed, followed by CSS and the JavaScript.  The page will parse from top to bottom, so it is best to place the JavaScript code towards the bottom of the page.
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?

    > You can find images for your website by searching on google images.  In order to avoid any copywrite issues you should use the license filter to search only for images with a *Creative Commons License*. There are also a variety of royalty free image sites that you can download from. Save the files to your computer, or save the direct URLS for later use.
4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

    > A string will be written with the value in quotation markes. *Example:* ```let myVariable = 'Bob';```\
      A number will be written without the quotation markes. *Example:* ```let myVariable = 10;```
5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

    > Variables are importation in JavaScript because they are what enable the program to do anything interesting.  It allows for dynamic data and custom interation with the user and the website/applciation.

### Introduction to HTML

1. What is an HTML attribute?

    > An HTML attribute is something that contrains additional information for the element.  It is written in the elements code to identify and define additional style information. For example, with an ```<a>``` tag, attributes such as ```href```, ```title``` and ```target``` are added to define a destination to the link, a title of the link to present to the browser and a behavior action as to how the page should load, either in the current browser window, or a new window.\
    > *Another example:* ![HTML Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png")
2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

    > An HTML element is going to be comprised of an opening tag with some content in between.\
    *Here is an example:* ![HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png)
3. What is the Difference between ```<article>``` and ```<section>``` element tags?

    > An ```<article>``` tag is used mainly for grouping single articles together.  They typically can web content that would be able to stand alone without relying on anything else on the page.\
    A ```<section>``` tag would be used to basically group content together on a single page.  In this scenario, the sections would tie together as a whole with the rest of the content on the page.  Most of the content on a page would be segmented with ```<section>``` tags.
4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
    > Most websites are going to include the following elements.\
    - ```<header>```
    - ```<nav>```
    - ```<main>```
    - ```<section>```
    - ```<div>```
    - ```<main>```
    - ```<footer>```
5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

    > Metadata has a big influence on search engine optimization (SEO).  The ```desription``` attribute in the ```<meta>``` can contain keywords that will be crawled by google that can help with SEO. It can also contaion a short description of the website, which will also be crawled by search engines and display in the search results. In addition, the ```title``` attribute within the ```<meta>``` is also helpful as it will be displayed as the sites title in search engines, making it useful when trying to optimize your site for search engines.\
    Here is an example: \
    ```<meta name="description" content="This website is all about cool stuff">```\
    ```<meta name="keywords" content="keyword 1, keyword 2...">```
6. How is the ```<meta>``` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
    > When using the ```<meta>``` tag, we use attributes such as ```name```, ```content``` and ```property``` to define how the meta to behave.  It can provide information such as an authors name, provide SEO data or even open graph data.

## Miscellaneous

### How to start to design a Website

1. What is the first step to designing a Website?
    > The first step in designing a website is determining what you want to accomplish.  Do you want to sell something to make money? Express a political opinion? Meet new people/friends? Collect random cat pictures?
2. What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?
    >The most important question to ask yourself is, *What do I want to accomplish?* Once you establish that, you can come up with goals, sort and prioritize. You can also determine if there are tools already out there that could handle your goals. If not, you need to evaluate if creating a website will handle your goals? Also ask the question, *How can a website help me reach my goals?*

### Semantics

1. Why should you use an ```<h1>``` element over a ```<span>``` element to display a top level heading?
    > An ```<h1>``` is a semantic tag, which means that the meaning of the tag is in the tag name itself.  So the top level header of a page title is ```<h1>```.  The page renders this tag with the largest font size for a title.  It is also has SEO benefits.  You could accomplish the same styling with a ```<span>``` tag, however, there would be no way of knowing if that was a top level header title or not.  There would also be no additional value, such as SEO benefits, by using a ```<span>``` tag over an ```<h1>``` tag.
2. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?
    > Some benefits of using semantic tags in HTML are:
    - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords.
    - Screen readers can use them to help visually impaired users.
    - Helps developers read the code when trying to edit
    - Helps developers find certain elements in the code

1. Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?
    > The 2 things that are required for JavaScript in the browser are the ```<script></script>``` tag and the actual scripting code, such as function.
