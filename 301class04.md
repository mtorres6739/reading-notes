## Reading for class 04

This topic is important because forms are the main way data is collected and passed in react applications. It also allows for greater user interaction.  Understanding this concept will allow me to create more dynamic and interactive react applications.

## React Docs - Forms

1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

    - A controlled component is a component, such as ```<input>, <textarea> and <select>``` that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**

    - We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them.  This is because the state is the single source of truth for the data in the form.  If we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form, the state will not be updated until the form is submitted.  This will cause the state to be out of sync with the form data.

3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

    - We can use the ```event.target.value``` property to target what the user is entering.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. **Why would we use a ternary operator?**

    - We would use a ternary operator to simplify an if statement. 

2. **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**
  
  ```javascript
  if(x===y){
    console.log(true);
  } else {
    console.log(false);
  }
  ```
```x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);```
