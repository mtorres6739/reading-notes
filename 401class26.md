## Android Fundamentals

1. **What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.**

  - An intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component. For example, you can use an intent to start an activity, start a service, deliver a broadcast, or retrieve a result from an activity. An example of an Intent in Android Studios would be to convey a request for an activity to show an image, open a webpage and even receive results.  An intent can also be used to issue a request to let the user pick a personal contact and return it to me. If I use the mid-term project as an example, an intent would be a request to let the user select an offer as their favorite offer.



2. **Describe an Activity in your own word.**

  - An activity is an entry point for interactivity the users. It's basically a single screen action with the the user interface that can work in concert with multiple other activities.  If we use our mid-term project as an example, showing a listing of all the seller's offers would be an activity.  View each offer could be another activity.  Sending a message on one of the offers could be an activity, etc.
