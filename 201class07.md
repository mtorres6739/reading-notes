## Reading for class 7

This topic is important because it's important to understand how tables and constructors work.  Tables are useful, but it's also important to know that it's not the best pay to layout a webpage.  Constructors is also good to know because it can make working with objects a lot easier.


## Domain Modeling

1. **Explain why we need domain modeling.**

    - We use domain model to get a visual representation of the structure of the application we are building.  You can see a visual depiction of all the content needed, the requirements, and the flow of that information and requirements. It provides the information needed so the requirements can be executed.

## HTML Table Basics

1. **Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

    - Layout tables reduce accessibility for the visually impaired. Screen readers will read out the table tags and they are more confusing to the user than if CSS was used and read by the screen reader.
    - Tables produce tag soup. Table layouts are more complex and more prone to errors.  This makes maintaining the code more difficult.
    - Tables are not auto responsive.  Extra effort is needed to style tables effectively.
  
2. **List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML ```<table>```.**

    - Table Data: ```<td>```, this is used to create the cell in the table.
    - Table Row: ```<tr>```, this is used to create the row in the table.
    - Table Header: ```<th>```, this is used to create the header in a table.  Normally, titles that describe the data in table will be used. For example, the header for the first column might read ```name``` with unique names is the proceeding rows under that column.

## Introducing Constructors

1. **What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

    - A constructor is basically a function called use a new keyword.  It creates a new onject, binds ```this``` to the new object so we can refer to ```this``` in the constructor code. It's advantage is it helps eliminate repetitive code.
  
2. **How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**

    - object literal ```this``` refers to the single instance of that object.
    - Constructor ```this``` refers to that being instantiated into multiple instances.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. **Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**

    - NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

      - I'm not really sure, but I think it's an object attached to an object. If the main object is set to prototype, it allows all the subsequent objects and functions to be able to reference or call on the data in the main object. 
      - An analogy from my previous job would be if my managers computer was a prototype, all the sales rep's computers would be able to access all his files for use on presentations we needed to make.
