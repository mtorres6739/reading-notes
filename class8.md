# Class 8 Reading Notes

_This class focused on Programming JavaScript Loops and Operators._
  ***

- **Operators**
  - We learned that javascript operators are special symbols that are used to perform various operations.  THey are used to perform mathematical and logical computations, even compare values There are multiple kinds of operators. You can use them for assignment, conditions or arithmetic.
    - let myNum = 0; ← assignment operator
    - myNum = myNum + 1;
    - myNum++; ← increment
    - myNum +=9 ← assignment as well
    - myNumber++; ← increment b 1 each time
    - myNumber += 7 ← increment by 7 each time

- **Arithmetic Operators**
  - operators that operate upon the numerical values and return a numerical value

- **Comparison Operators**
  - Mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values

- **Logical Operators**
  - A symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing)

- **Assignment Operators**
  - Assigns the value of right-hand operand to its left-hand operand

- **Ternary Operators**
  - The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

- **typeof Operator**
  - Returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand

    - (+) Addition
    - (-) Subtraction
    - (*) Multiplication
    - (**) Exponentiation (ES2016)
    - (/) Division
    - (%) Modulus (Division Remainder)
    - (++) Increment
    - (--) Decrement
