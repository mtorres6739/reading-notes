# Code 201: Class 4 Reading Notes

## Reading for class 4

This class focuses on creating hyperlines, CSS layout, JavaScript and pair programming.  These are all very important topics to understand when building web pages.  Links are everywhere in websites, that is how we move around.  Also understanding the basics of CSS layout is crucial because it will allow us to better understand the strucure when we get ready to build more complex pages.  JavaScript is obviously critical in user interaction, so everything we can learn there will only help us become better developers.  Pair programming is a new concept for me, but it is a common practice in the development world so it is important to practice.

## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

1. **To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

    - We wrap the text in an ```<a>``` tag.

2. **The href attribute contains what information?**

    - This contains the web address. Example: ```http://www.google.com```

3. **What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

    - Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text.
    - Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text.
    - Keep your link text as short as possible.
    - Don't have multiple instances of the same text linked to different places

## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. **What is meant by “normal flow”?**

    - Normal flow is how a webapage is laid out without any css applied.

2. **What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**

    - Block level elements start on a new line.
    - Inline level elements can start anywhere on a line.

3. **___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

    - Static

4. **Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

    - We can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.
    - You can use a z-axis and arrange items in a stacked order on a page.
    - Elements no longer exist in th normal flow.

5. **What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

    - Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.[3]

## Learn JS

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

    - With a function declaration, we are creating the actual function.  We are giving it the conditions and parameters to follow, the instructions.
    - With a function invoation, we are basically calling the function to duty.  We are saying, "Hey function, over here, I need you to do your thing."

2. **What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

    - The parameters are basically the names listed in a function.
    - The arguments are the values passed to the function.

## Miscellaneous

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

    - One benefit is greater efficiency.  As one person codes, they other can provide insight into the bigger picture and might be able to see bugs before the person coding does.  Also, if both are rearching a solution to an issue, they can come up with a potential answer a lot faster.
    - Since most companies already utilize some form of pair proramming, getting a head start on it now sets us up for success.  By doing pair programming now, we will already be familiar with the process when we get to an employer who does pair programming.
