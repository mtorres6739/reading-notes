### Trees

- A tree represents the nodes connected edges.  It's a special data structure used for data storage. It has a special condition that each node can only have a max of two children. A tree can use both an ordered array and a linked list as its search. 

- A binary tree is a tree that has a max of two children. A binary tree has a root, left child, and right child.


### Binary Tree Traversals

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root


### Binary Search Trees

- A binary search tree is a binary tree that has a special condition. The left child of a node must be less than the parent node and the right child must be greater than the parent node.


### K-ary Trees

- A k-ary tree is a tree that has a max of k children.


### Breadth First Traversals

- Breadth first traversals are traversals that use a queue. It starts at the root and goes down each level.


### Depth First Traversals

- Depth first traversals are traversals that use a stack. It starts at the root and goes down each branch.

## Important Terms

- Node: A node is a single item in a tree.
- Root: The root is the top node in a tree.
- Left Child: The left child is the node that is to the left of the root.
- Right Child: The right child is the node that is to the right of the root.
- Edge: An edge is the connection between one node and another.
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
- Height: The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the bottom node.
- K: K is the max number of children a node can have.
- Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.
- Breadth: The breadth of a tree is the number of nodes on the widest level of the tree.
- Binary Tree: A binary tree is a tree that has a max of two children.
- Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree that has a special condition. The left child of a node must be less than the parent node and the right child must be greater than the parent node.
- K-ary Tree: A k-ary tree is a tree that has a max of k children.
- Traversal: Traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree.
- Depth First Traversal: Depth first traversals are traversals that use a stack. It starts at the root and goes down each branch.
- Breadth First Traversal: Breadth first traversals are traversals that use a queue. It starts at the root and goes down each level.
- Pre-order: Pre-order is a type of traversal that goes root >> left >> right.
- In-order: In-order is a type of traversal that goes left >> root >> right.
- Post-order: Post-order is a type of traversal that goes left >> right >> root.
- Level Order: Level order is a type of traversal that goes level by level from left to right.
- Path - PAth refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of the tree.
- Root - The node at the top of the tree is the root.  Only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
- Parent - Any node except the root is node has one edge wpward to a node called parent.
- Child - Any node can have multiple nodes coming out from it called children.
- Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
- Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
- Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
- Keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.


## Insert Operation 

### Algorithm

```java
If root is NULL 
   then create root node
return

If root exists then
   compare the data with node.data
   
   while until insertion position is located

      If data is greater than node.data
         goto right subtree
      else
         goto left subtree

   endwhile 
   
   insert data
 
end If      
```

### Implementation

```java
void insert(int data) {
   struct node *tempNode = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
   struct node *current;
   struct node *parent;

   tempNode->data = data;
   tempNode->leftChild = NULL;
   tempNode->rightChild = NULL;

   //if tree is empty, create root node
   if(root == NULL) {
      root = tempNode;
   } else {
      current = root;
      parent  = NULL;

      while(1) {                
         parent = current;

         //go to left of the tree
         if(data < parent->data) {
            current = current->leftChild;                
            
            //insert to the left
            if(current == NULL) {
               parent->leftChild = tempNode;
               return;
            }
         }
   
         //go to right of the tree
         else {
            current = current->rightChild;
            
            //insert to the right
            if(current == NULL) {
               parent->rightChild = tempNode;
               return;
            }
         }
      }            
   }
}
```

## Search Operation 

### Algorithm

```java
If root.data is equal to search.data
   return root
else
   while data not found

      If data is greater than node.data
         goto right subtree
      else
         goto left subtree
         
      If data found
         return node
   endwhile 
   
   return data not found
   
end if   
```

### Implementation

```java
struct node* search(int data) {
   struct node *current = root;
   printf("Visiting elements: ");

   while(current->data != data) {
      if(current != NULL)
      printf("%d ",current->data); 
      
      //go to left tree

      if(current->data > data) {
         current = current->leftChild;
      }
      //else go to right tree
      else {                
         current = current->rightChild;
      }

      //not found
      if(current == NULL) {
         return NULL;
      }
   }
   return current;
}
```
