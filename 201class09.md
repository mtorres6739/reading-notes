### Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

1. **Why are forms so important in web development?**

    - Web forms are important because they are the main point of interaction between a user and a website or application.
  
2. **When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**

    - It's important to keep in mind how much data you actually need to collect.
    - Make buttons look like buttons, label them correctly and put them in a sensible order.
3. **List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

    - ```<form>``` This element defines a form. You would use this every time you want to create a form.
    - ```<input>``` This creates an input field on your form.  It's a single line text field where a user can enter data, like their name.
    - ```<textarea>``` This is an input field that is a multiline text field.  This is where a user might enter lots of text data, for example a response to survey question that is lengthy.
    - ```<button>``` This creates the actual button that a user would click on to submit the form data.
    -```<label>``` This creates the actual label that would correspond to the input field.  For example, if you have an input field for a "First Name" you would have a that would print out "First Name". ```<label>First Name</label>```

### Introduction To Events.

1. **How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**

    - Events would be any actions or occurrences that happen based on user interaction. For example, when a user clicks a submit button, that is an event.
  
2. **When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**

    - The name of the event we want to register this handler for.
    - The code that comprises the handler function we want to run in response to it.
3. **Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**

    - An event object is a parameter specified with a name such as ```event, evt or e``` and is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. It's useful because it makes it easier to reference the event object.
4. **What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?****

    - Bubbling - Works from the inside out. The browser checks to see if the event handler for the click registered in the inner most child, and then outward to the parent.
    - Capturing - Works from the outside in, the exact opposite of Bubbling. The browser checks to see if the event handler for the click registered in the outward most parent and then in to the inner most child.
