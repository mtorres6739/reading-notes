## Reading for class 3

### Primitive vs Object

- Primitive types are stored directly in the variable, while object types are stored in a reference to the object.  This means that when you assign a primitive type to a variable, you are assigning the value of that variable.  When you assign an object type to a variable, you are assigning a reference to the object.  This means that if you change the value of the variable, you are not changing the value of the object, you are changing the reference to the object.  This is why if you change the value of a primitive type, it will not change the value of the object, but if you change the value of an object type, it will change the value of the object.

### Exceptions in Java

- Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.  

### Using a Scanner in a Java File

- To use a scanner in a java file, you must import the scanner class from the java.util package. You can then create a new scanner object and use it to read input from the user.
