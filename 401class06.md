## Reading for class 6

1. **What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?**
  
      - An object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint for an object. An object is a concrete thing, and a class is a conceptual thing.

2. **What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.**

      - A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. 

      - For example, the Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

3. **Static methods are also called what? Why?**

      - Static methods are also called class methods. They are called class methods because they are called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.
