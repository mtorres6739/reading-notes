## Reading for class 14a

This topic is important because it talks about the different types of transitions and animations that are possible in CSS.  These things aid in user engagement on our websites.  Ultimately, we want users to stay on the page and not leave.  Having these types of effects on our page will help keeps our users engaged.  

## CSS Transforms

1. **What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

    - It allows the developer to transform an element across the x, y and z axis. We can move and element, scale it, rotate, transform it, etc.
  
2. **Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

    - You can scale an element to make it larger, or smaller.  You can also rotate element.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. **What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

    - Transitions allow you to change the behavior of an element.  You can morph things into a different shape.  For example ease in on a border radius to make a box appear to be transitioning into a circle.  You can also ease text in an out, up and down, bounce,etc, to give some movement on the page.
  
2. **How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

    - Animation takes transitions a step further and allows you to do more complex movement with your elements. For example, maybe you want to move element across the screen in a circle. Animation will let you do that.

## Readings from Class 14b

- This article discusses the differences between two distinct types of groups.  One group that is comprised of mainly smart and driven academic types who stick to the agenda and are all business.  The other group is more free flowing, comprised of people of various background, some smart, some not as smart and they are not all business in the meetings.  It basically highlighted that the second group was actually more productive than the first because people felt more open to discuss and share ideas.  They were actually able to be more productive.  This was counter intuitive to what all the researchers thought would happen.
- This rings true in my last job. I started out working for a team where the leader was a micro manager and the meetings were always all business.  There was never any deviating from the agenda, and the meetings always felt like a chore.  We rarely hit our goals.  In contrast, I moved teams later on and the manager was the complete opposite.  Sometimes we would talk about business, sometimes it was just to touch base and share.  There was usually a small piece of business that was discussed, but it never felt like a chore to attend these meetings. We actually hit our goals in this group.
