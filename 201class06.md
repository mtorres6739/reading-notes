## Reading for class 6

This class topic is important because objects makes things more streamlined when we start to work with more data and arrays.  It's also important to understand the DOM, as that is what we use to manipulate the content on a webpage and makes things more interactive with the user.

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. **How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

    - An object in JavaScript is a way to bundle up a bunch of different values and functions so you can use them somewhere else without having to rewrite a bunch of code.
  
2. **What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

    - Some of advantages of creating object literals is that it's a much more simplified way of using functions in an object.  It makes it easier when you are trying to transfer data to a database, for example.
  
3. **How do objects differ from arrays?**

    - They are very similar, however, instead of calling on an index with an array, you would call on the member's value. This makes mapping values easier to read and understand.
  
4. **Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

    - You would use bracket notation when you are trying to access an object's property. For example, if an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets. [1]
5. **Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**

    - When using ```this``` it means that you are referencing that specific objects value in the current object's code it's being writing inside.  When you use ```this```, you are able to replicate that definition for every object you create and still get a unique result to ```this```.

```
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```

## Introduction To The DOM

1. **What is the DOM?**

    - This is the Document Object Model.  It represents that page's structure, style and content as nodes and objects that can be interacted with via JavaScript. It's basically an API.
  
2. **Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

    - JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements.  We are able to manipulate the page using the DOM with JavaScript.
