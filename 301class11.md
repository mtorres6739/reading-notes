## Reading for class 11

This topic is important because databases are a staple in the world of web development and it's crucial we know how to build, maintain and interact with them. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is very popular in the field.  It's a very flexible database that is easy to use and maintain, so we will encounter it more often than not.

## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL | NoSQL

1. Relational Databases | Non-relational or distributed database
2. table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
3. predefined schema for each table | dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. vertically scalable | horizontally scalable
5. structured query language | Un-structured query language

1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

    - SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

2. **Give a real world example.**

    - MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

    - NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

4. **Give a real world example.**

    - MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

    - NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

    - NoSQL databases are highly preferred for scalability.

## sql vs nosql (Video)

1. **What does SQL stand for?**

    - Structured Query Language

2. **What is a relational database?**

    - A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

    - Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

4. **What is a ‘schema’?**

    - A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

5. **What is a NoSQL database?**

    - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases.

6. **How does it work?**

    - NoSQL databases work by storing data in a format other than relational tables. They store data in a JSON-like format, which is called a document. This makes it easier to store and retrieve data.

7. **What is inside of a Mongo database?**

    - A Mongo database contains collections and documents, made up of key-value pairs. The key is the name of the data, and the value is the data itself.

8. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

    - MongoDB is more flexible because it is a NoSQL database. It is not bound by the rules of a relational database. It is also easier to scale.

9. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

    - The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it is not as structured as a relational database. This means that it is harder to maintain and update.
