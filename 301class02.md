## Reading for class 02

This topic is important because ...

## React lifecycle

1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**

    - Render.

2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

    - Mounting.

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen:**```componentDidMount```, ```render```, ```constructor```, ```componentWillUnmount```, ```React Updates```

    - Constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount.

4. **What does ```componentDidMount``` do?**

    - It is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Good place to set up subscriptions.

## React State Vs Props

1. **What types of things can you pass in the props?**

  - Values.  Can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc. Like an initial count value to a counter.

2. **What is the big difference between props and state?**

    - Props are passed into the component and state is handled inside the component. Props are immutable and state is mutable. 

3. **When do we re-render our application?**

    - When the state changes.

4. **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**

    - Forms, counters, etc.
