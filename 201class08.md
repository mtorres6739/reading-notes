## Reading for class 8

This topic is important because understanding concepts like flexbox are going to help me become a better web developer.  Flexbox allows you to design layouts that function much better than other CSS features like float.


## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. **Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**

    - t only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time.

2. **Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**

    - The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.  The main axis would be a row, and the cross axis would be the column.
3. **How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**

    - ```row-reverse``` and ```column-reverse``` are good examples of this negatively affecting accessibility. Reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. The logical order is the order that a screen reader will read and that can trip up some users using the page.
