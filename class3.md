# Class 3 Reading Notes

_This class stressed the importance of git and github. We also went over the differences between git and github and the correct usage of the commands in terminal._

- **git (version control)**
  - git is a distributed version control system
  - It keeps track of all our code changes
  - It keeps all our project files in one respository
  - It makes collaboration with others possible
  - It lets multiple developers work on the same code

- **Keeping track of commits**
  - It helps to think of git as snapshots in a point of time for your files
  - Commits represent each successfive version of a file or files.
  - It's the same as doing a _save as_ function in a word document
  - It keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time.

- **Keeping track of commits**
  - Each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it.
  - HEAD - THe lael meaning “you are here”
  - You can also assign messages to commits
  - Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot

- **Difference between git and github**
  - GItHub is the place that we store our glub
  - Github is not git
  - A way to share code with others
  - It uses git to help you manage your teams work
    - Version tracking
      - Reviewing changes
      - Keeping changes separate until you want to add them in

- **Github (online code storage)**
  - Can have multiple in the same file at the same time without messing each other up
  - Keep a history of files over time
  - Work on code on your own computer and then sync it with what's online
  - On github all the code is public

- **Repositories (repos)**
  - A collection of files that you've told git to pay attention to
  - Usually, one project  = one repository
  - Really large projects might have multiple repositories for different parts of their system (front end vs back end)
  - Repositories can live on github and/or your computer

- **gitfow (acp)**
  - Add
  - Commit
  - Push

> git status _(helps to see what’s going on, do it all the time to check)_

> git add FILENAME.md  _(tab will autocomplete the file name)_

> git add . _(adds all files in folder that have changes)_

> git commit -m “Made changes to my README because it was blank”

> git push origin main

> git pull
