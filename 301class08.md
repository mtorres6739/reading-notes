## Reading for class 08

This topic is important because understanding good API design will help us to use API's more efficiently.  It will also help us to understand how to use API's that we did not create.

## API Design Best Practices

1. **What does REST stand for?**

    - REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is a set of constraints that developers follow when creating their API's.

2. **REST APIs are designed around a ____.**

    - Resources

3. **What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.**

    - An identifier of a resource is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource.  For example, the URI for a specific user would be https://adventure-works.com/users/1.

4. **What are the most common HTTP verbs?**

    - The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. **What should the URIs be based on?**

    - URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

6. **Give an example of a good URI.**

    - https://adventure-works.com/orders

7. **What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**

    - A chatty web API is one that requires a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires.  This is a bad thing because it requires more time and bandwidth to retrieve the data. It is also bad because it can make the application less responsive.

8. **What status code does a successful GET request return?**

    - A successful GET request returns a status code of 200 (OK).

9. **What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**

    - An unsuccessful GET request returns a status code of 404 (Not Found).

10. **What status code does a successful POST request return?**

    - A successful POST request returns a status code of 201 (Created).

11. **What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**

    - A successful DELETE request returns a status code of 204 (No Content).
