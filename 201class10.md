## Reading for class 10

This topic is important because there is inevitably going to be issues and problems at arise from our code.  Having a good set of tools and knowing how to use those tools is going to save a lot of time and energy when trying to debug.  


## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

    - A syntax error is more of a spelling error in your code, or forgetting to place a comma or semicolon.
    - A logic error is where the code is written correctly, but the code is not written in the way you intended it to run.  THe programs runs it, but is unsuccessful or gives wrong results.
  
2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

    - I have had many syntax errors in past assignments.  Most of the time it was forgetting to place a semicolon somewhere.  I basically had to comb through my code and try to find the error.  I also had someone else look at it with a fresh set of eyes to see if they could see anything wrong.  Usually, having someone else look at my code was key to finding issues.
  
3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

    - Errors are going to happen so it is a good idea to know what kind of errors can occur.  This is a great topic because it goes in to depth on the right way to debug.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

1. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

    - I would say that it's a tool built in the browser that helps you find problems or issues in your code.  It's like an extra set of eyes that can highlight issues.
2. **Define what a breakpoint is.**

    - A breakpoint is a tool in devtools debugger that can isolate a certain section of your code.  You can basically define a point in which to stop the code so you can debug line by line.
  
3. **What is the call stack?**

    - This is basically telling you the code that was executed and where it was executed.
