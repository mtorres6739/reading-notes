_This class focused on the structure of HTML, identifying certain tags and elements and understanding the importance of wire framing._

- **Wire Frameing**
  - We learned that before you being to code a webpage or application, it's important to understand the flow of the webpage or application.  Sketching out a simple wire frame, or the bare bones, of a site will allow for corrections and adjustments to be made.  It allows users to test the design and make sure that the user minimizes any frustration with trying to interact with the site.  Simple interface concept may seem easy in our mind, but when they are put on paper they could mean something different to another user.  
  - It's important to sketch out your design with pen and paper first, then after the very rough sketch is confirmed, moving on to a web based wire framing application is done.  Wire frame applications make the process of documenting the work flow of the design much easier.  There are multiple options out there for creating your wire frame.

- **HTML**
  - Structure of a webpage
  - Foundation of a webpage that other languages sit on top of, like CSS and javascript
  - Hypertext Markup Language
  - Contains elements/tags
  - Need main, header, body 
  - 6 header sizes/tags
  - HTML has self closing tags
  - <img href=”path-or-link” /> ← new way
  - <img href=”path-or-link”> ← old way
