## Reading for class 09

This topic is important because in react there is a lot if use of functional programming.  It is important to understand what functional programming is and how it is used.  There are also a lot of modules that are used in react.  Understanding the structure of these modules will help us to be more efficient in our work.


## Functional Programming Concepts

1. **What is functional programming?**

    - Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

    - A pure function is a function that has the following properties:
        - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred to as deterministic).
        - It does not cause any observable side effects.

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

    - The benefits of a pure function are:
        - The code is easier to test.
        - The code is easier to read and understand.
        - The code is easier to debug.

4. **What is immutability?**

    - Immutability is when data is immutable, i.e. it cannot be changed.

5. **What is Referential transparency?**

    - Referential transparency is when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. **What is a module?**

    - A module is a file that contains a set of related functions.

2. **What does the word ‘require’ do?**

    - The word 'require' is used to import the module.

3. **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

    - We bring another module into the file that we are working in by using the 'require' keyword.

4. **What do we have to do to make a module available?**

    - We have to export the module.
