## Reading for class 11

This topic is important because images and videos make up a big part of the user experience online.  Load times are also crucial to provide a positive user experience.  The topics discussed in this section are all about reducing load times for media and improving the user experience.  As software developers, this is important for us to know.  We are striving to optimize our code to serve up the most optimized user experience for as many users as possible.

## Video and Audio Content

1. **Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**

    - Early online video from the early 2000's used technologies like Flash and Silverlight, which had security and accessibility issues.  Today, we use native HTML solutions and JavaScript APIs for controlling video.

2. **Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the ```<video>``` element.**

    - The ```<video>``` element enables you to embed a video.  
    - The ```src``` attribute is the source of the video, its the path in which the video can be found.  It's very similar to the ```src``` attribute in an ```<img>``` tag.
    - The ```controls``` attribute is pretty important, as it gives the user the ability to control the video, like being able to at least start and stop the video.

3. **Why is it important to have fallback content inside the ```<video>``` element?**

    - In case the browser does not support the ```<video>``` element, the paragraph inside the ```<video>``` tag will display. This is a fallback in case older browsers that do not support the ```<video>``` tag are used.

4. **Write a very short story where ```<audio>``` and ```<video>``` are characters.**

    - ```<video>``` and ```<audio>``` walked up to a ride at Disneyland.  ```<video>``` was able to get on, but ```<audio>``` had to stay behind. ```<audio>``` did not meet the height and width requirement since he had none.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. **How does Grid layout differ from Flex?**

    - Flexbox is one-dimensional flow whereas Grid is two-dimensional flow.
  
2. **Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.**

    - Grid Container: This is the direct parent of all the grid items.
    - Grid Item: This is the children of a grid container.
    - Grid Line: This is the dividing line that makes up the structure of the grid.

## Responsive Images

1. **Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**

    - Having responsive images makes viewing the page and images easier if the viewport gets smaller in size.  For example, a mobile device is going to have a smaller viewport than a desktop.  Having images that adjust to the viewport will make for a better user experience.

2. **Define the following ```<img>``` attributes ```srcset``` and ```sizes```. Write an example of how they are used.**

    - ```<img>``` tag is used to define the image.
    - ```srcset``` is the set of images in which to the browser will cycle through to determine the best image for the viewport the user is using.
    - ```sizes``` defines a set of media conditions and indicates what image size would be the best one to choose when certain media conditions are true.

3. **How is ```srcset``` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?**

    - ```srcset``` is more helpful because the images in the ```srcset``` do not load by the browser immediately.  In fact, the browser will only load one of them based on the users view port and the conditions we set.  With JavaScript, all the images would load and therefor take up resources, causing slower load times for the user.
