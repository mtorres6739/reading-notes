## Questions

1. **What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?**

- Shared Preferences are similar to cookies in that they are both used to store data.  Cookies are used to store data on the client side, while Shared Preferences are used to store data on the server side.

2. **Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.**

- Testing is important because it helps to ensure that the code is working as expected.  It also helps to ensure that the code is working as expected in different environments, situations and scenarios. The most important aspect to me is that it helps to ensure that the code is working as expected in different scenarios.  This is important because there are many different scenarios that can occur when the code is being used.  For example, the code may work as expected when the user is using the app on their phone, but it may not work as expected when the user is using the app on their tablet.  Testing helps to ensure that the code is working as expected in different scenarios.

3. **Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.**

- Tasks and the back stack are similar to the browser's back button.  When you click on a link, it takes you to a new page.  When you click the back button, it takes you back to the previous page.  This can go on for any number of activities.  The back stack is a list of activities that are in the task.  We have used something similar to this before when we used the browser's back button.
