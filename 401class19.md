## Purely functional programming

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- Functional programming is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

## Difference between pure and impure functional programming

- Pure functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- Impure functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Properties of purely functional programming

- Pure functions are functions that have no side effects. They always return the same result if the same arguments are passed in. They also do not modify the state of the application.

## Benefits of purely functional programming

- Pure functions are easier to test. They do not depend on any state, so you simply pass in the arguments and get the result.

- Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result. It makes your functions easier to reason about.

- Pure functions are self-documenting. Pure functions are easier to test. They do not depend on any state, so you simply pass in the arguments and get the result.

## Strict vs non-strict evaluation

- Strict evaluation is an evaluation strategy in which an expression is fully evaluated before it is passed as an argument to a function.

- Non-strict evaluation is an evaluation strategy in which an expression is not fully evaluated before it is passed as an argument to a function.
