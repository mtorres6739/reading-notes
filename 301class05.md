## Reading for class 05

This topic is important because javascript is full of higher order functions and react is all about components. We need to understand how to use them in order make our code more efficient and readable.


## React Docs - Thinking in React

1. **What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?**

    - The single responsibility principle states that a component should ideally only do one thing.  If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

2. **What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?**

    - A static version of an app is one that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.  It's a version that renders the data model without any state.

3. **Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?**

    - Once you have a static app, you need to add interactivity.  This is done by adding state to the components.

4. **What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?**

    - Is it passed in from a parent via props?
    - Does it remain unchanged over time?
    - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?

5. **How can you identify where state needs to live?**

    - Identify every component that renders something based on that state. Find a common owner component. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.  If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component just for holding the state and add it somewhere else in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher-Order Functions

1. **What is a “higher-order function”?**

    - A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

2. **Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?**

    - Line 2 returns a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean value. It's checking to see if the number passed in is greater than the number passed into the greaterThan function. If it is, it returns true, if not it returns false.

3. **Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.**

    - Map and reduce are higher-order functions that take a function as an argument and return a function. Map takes an array and a function as arguments and returns a new array.  Reduce takes an array and a function as arguments and returns a single value.
