# Topic Summary

## Code 101

This is a summary of the material I learned in this class.

### Class 1

- **Setting up Accounts**
  - CANVAS
    - Leanred that this is the main learning management system where all the content and course materials will be stored.
  - REMO
    - This is the collaborative lab environment where you can break out into small groups, virtually.  Here you are able to chat with small teams and work on projects.  Instructors are also able to screen share and troubleshoot any issues you might have.
  - Slack
    - Slack is the main communication platform that the entire class can utilize to collaborate and ask questions.  It's connected to the entire school, not just your classroom.  This is great if you want to connect with other students and instructors outside of the normal class hours.
  - GitHub
    - This is the main online platform that will house all of our respositories and will eventually be a showcase of our work for future employers to view.  This is going to be an evolving profile that will grow with us as our skills develop.

- **Learning Markdown**
  - This is another language that creates webpages similar to HTML.  It is easier than HTML as most of the syntax is more simplified and you can accomplish the same thing as HTML but with less syntax.

### Class 2

- **The Coder's Computer**
  - In this class we setup our computers with all the neccessary programs that will enable our machines to be a proper coding environment.  We installed programs via the command terminal which include:
    - Homebrew
    - git
    - node
    - live server
    - eslint
    - tree
    - zsh
    - VS code
   - We learned the difference between basic text editors and coding-specific editors, like VS code.  VS code allows for full functionality for making it easier to write code.  For example, some sysntax will auto-populate when writing the first few characters of code.  VS code will also color code your text, highlight in color codes for certain functions, and also identify any problems in coding syntax and provide solutions. Overall, a coding-specufic platform like VS code is significantly more efficient than a standard text editor that has none of the features mentioned.
