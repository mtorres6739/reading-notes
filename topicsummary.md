# Topic Summary
_This is a summary of the material I learned in this class._

## Code 101

### Class 1
_This class stressed the importance of setting up our accounts and ensure the profiles matched from profile to profile._

- **Setting up Accounts**
  - CANVAS
    - Leanred that this is the main learning management system where all the content and course materials will be stored.
  - REMO
    - This is the collaborative lab environment where you can break out into small groups, virtually.  Here you are able to chat with small teams and work on projects.  Instructors are also able to screen share and troubleshoot any issues you might have.
  - Slack
    - Slack is the main communication platform that the entire class can utilize to collaborate and ask questions.  It's connected to the entire school, not just your classroom.  This is great if you want to connect with other students and instructors outside of the normal class hours.
  - GitHub
    - This is the main online platform that will house all of our respositories and will eventually be a showcase of our work for future employers to view.  This is going to be an evolving profile that will grow with us as our skills develop.

- **Learning Markdown**
  - This is another language that creates webpages similar to HTML.  It is easier than HTML as most of the syntax is more simplified and you can accomplish the same thing as HTML but with less syntax.

### Class 2
_This class focused on the proper setup of our machines to provide an efficient coding environment. It involved downloading the correct applications and understanding how to use the command line terminal_

- **The Coder's Computer**
   
  - Programs installed via the command terminal include:
       - Homebrew
       - git
       - node
       - live server
       - eslint
       - tree
       - zsh
       - VS code
 
   - Text Editors vs Code-Specific Editors
       - We learned the difference between basic text editors and coding-specific editors, like VS code.  VS code allows for full functionality for making it easier to write code.  For example, some systax will auto-populate and auto-complete when writing the first few characters of code. For example, when opening a bracket, there will be an automatic closed bracket created.  VS code will also color code your text, highlight in color codes for certain functions, and also identify any problems in coding syntax and provide solutions. Overall, a coding-specufic platforms like VS code is significantly more efficient than a standard text editor that has none of the features mentioned. Also worth noting, there are a multitude of code-specific editors other than VS code.  VS code just happens to be the one I enjoy using the most.
   
   - The Command Line Terminal
      - We learned the basic commands of the command line terminal so that we may be able to create and name directories, move around the differnt folders, create files and install programs. 
      - Basic Commands
        - **pwd** (_print working directory_)
        - **ls** (_list the contents of the directory/folder_)
        - **cd** (_move to a new folder/change directory_)
        - **mkdir** (_make a new directory/folder_)
        - **clear** (_clear out the terminal_)
        - **touch** (_create a file_)
        - **code .** (_open up VS code from terminal_)
        - **cd ..** (_go back in the directory - the number of dots equals the number of directories to go back_)
        - **tree** (_see a visual representation of all the directories and files_)
