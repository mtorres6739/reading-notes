## Reading for class 2

These readings went over HTML basics, such as semantics.  It also went over CSS and JavaScript.  These are very important topics to cover because they are the foundation to web development.  HTML is essential because it renders the content on the page.  CSS is critcal because it provides for styling of the contnet.  Styling could be how the font looks, and how things are arranged on a page.  JavaScript providers for user interaction with the web page, so it is also an essential topic to cover.  JavaScript is the brains behing the different functions of a web page, the user interactivity and functionality of the page.

### Introduction to HTML continued

1. **Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

    It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because a semantic element is decriptive.  For example, an ```<h1>``` is used to indicate a top level header.  This can be read and understood by search engines and browser readers.  If you used a ```<span>``` tag instead and just styled it to look like a top level header, it would look the same, but it would not have the benefit of the search engines crawling it and the aid of screen readers.
2. **How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

    There are 6 levels of headings in HTML utilize the ```<h>``` tag.
3. **What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?**

    These are used for superscript and subscript. This is used when markup dates, chemical formulas and when showing mathematical formulas.
4. **When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

    the ```title``` attribute must be added to give the full expansion.

### Learn CSS

1. **What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

    We can apply CSS in 3 ways. External stylesheet, Internal Stylesheet and Inline.
2. **Why should we avoid using inline styles?**

    We should avoid using inline styles because it is the most inefficient and it clutters up our code.  It mixes both presentational code with HTML and content. Since it usually only affects one HTML element, it becomes very inefficient when we may need to update multiple elements.

3. **Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**

    - **What is representing the selector?**

        ```h2``` is representing the selector
    - **Which components are the CSS declarations?**

      ```color: black;``` and ```padding: 5px``` are the css declarations. CSS declarations are the pairing of the css property and its value.
    - **Which components are considered properties?**

      ```color``` and ```padding``` are considered the properties.

```
h2 {
color: black;
padding: 5px;
}
```

### Learn JS

1. **What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?**

    A ```string``` is the type of data that is enclosed in since quote marks.

2. **List 4 types of JavaScript operators.**

    Four types of JavaScript operators are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

3. **Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**

    A real world problem you can solve with a function would be a simple mathematical problem.  For example, you can have a function multiple two numbers together like 3 * 3 = 9.

### Making decisions in your code - Conditionals

1. **An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.**

    An if statement checks a ```condition``` and if it evaluates to ```true```, the the code block will execute.

2. **What is the use of an else if?**

    It's a way to chain extra choices/outcomes to your ```if...else``` function.

3. **List 3 different types of comparison operators.**

    3 types of comparison operators are:
      - ```===``` and ```!==```
      -  ```<``` and ```>```
      - ```<=``` and ```>=```

4. **What is the difference between the logical operator ```&&``` and ```||```?**

    The ```&&``` operator lets you chain 2 or more expressions togehter so that all of them have to individually be true in order for the whole expression to be true. (same for false)

    The ```||``` operator lets you hcain 2 or more expressions together so that one or more of them have to individually be true in order for the whole expression to be true. (same for false)
