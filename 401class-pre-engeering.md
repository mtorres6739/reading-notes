## Engineering

1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

    - The one thing I can bring to this career that nobody else can is my personality and my life experiences.  I have a unique combination of skills and experiences that will make me a valuable asset to any company.

2. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

    - I will take breaks, when needed.  I will take a break from the problem and do something else for a while.  I will then come back to the problem with a fresh mind.  
    - I will write out the problem and the steps I have taken to solve it.  I will then look at the problem from a different perspective.  
    - I will ask for help from a peer or a mentor.
