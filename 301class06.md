## Reading for class 06

This topic is important because node.js is a server side javascript runtime environment that allows us to run javascript on the server.  We are going to be using node.js a lot when we start working in the tech industry.  Having a strong understanding of this will help us be better developers.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

    - Greater efficiency
    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
    - Social skills
    - Job interview readiness
    - Work environment readiness

2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

    - I've found that learning from fellow students has been the most beneficial for me when pair programming.  It's interesting to see how others approach a problem and how they solve it.  It's also helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of.

3. **How does pair programming work?**

    - Pair programming is when two developers work together on one project.  One developer is the driver and the other is the navigator.  The driver is the one who is typing and the navigator is the one who is thinking about the code and how to solve the problem.  The navigator is also the one who is looking at the code and making sure it's correct.
