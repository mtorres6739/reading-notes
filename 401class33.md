## Questions

1. **Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.**

- Asynchronous actions are actions that are not executed in the order they are called. They are executed in the order they are completed. This is useful when you have a long running process that you want to run in the background and not block the main thread. This is also useful when you have multiple processes that you want to run at the same time.

2. **What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?**

- The benefit of asynchronous methods is that they allow you to run multiple processes at the same time. This is useful when you have a long running process that you want to run in the background and not block the main thread. This is also useful when you have multiple processes that you want to run at the same time.
