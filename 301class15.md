## Reading for class 15

This topic is important because most web applications we are going to be exposed to are going to require some sort of authentication. It's important to understand how to implement authentication in a web app if we want to be competitive in the job market.

## What is OAuth

1. **What is OAuth?**

    - OAuth is an open standard for access delegation. It's used to give users the ability to grant application access to services, without giving the application their password. It grants limited access to their accounts on one service to another service, without having to expose their password by logging in to multiple services.

2. **Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

    - When you go to log into a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log in using another website's log in. For example, you can log into a website using your Facebook or Google log in.

3. **How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

    - The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user's verified identity.
    - The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
    - The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user's client software.
    - The client's software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site). If not, the client may be asked to authenticate directly with the authorization provider. The client may then receive an approved access token (it's no longer a request token).
    - The user gives the approved access token to the first site.
    - The first site gives the access token to the second site as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
    - The second site lets the first site access their site on behalf of the user.
    - The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

4. **What is OpenID?**

    - OpenID is about authentication, not authorization. It's for humans logging into machines, not machines logging into machines. It's about humans logging into sites (or machines) and machines (or sites) verifying the identity of humans.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

1. **What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

    - Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

2. **What is Authorization Code Flow?**

    - Authorization Code Flow is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. It'a the recommended flow for server-side web apps.

3. **What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

    - Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for public clients, such as native and single-page apps. It's the recommended flow for mobile apps and single-page apps. It is also used for server-side web apps that are unable to securely store a client secret.

4. **What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

    - Implicit Flow with Form Post is used to obtain access tokens and is optimized for public clients, such as native and single-page applications. It's the recommended flow for mobile apps and single-page apps. It's also used to obtain ID tokens to obtain user information.

5. **What is Client Credentials Flow?**

    - Client Credentials Flow is used to obtain access tokens for machine-to-machine authentication. It's the recommended flow for server-to-server apps. It's also used to obtain access tokens for server-side web app.

6. **What is Device Authorization Flow?**

    - Device Authorization Flow is used to obtain access tokens for devices that do not have access to a browser, like smart TVs, media consoles, and printers. It's the recommended flow for devices that don't have access to a browser. It is also used to obtain access tokens for input-constrained devices.

7. **What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**

    - Resource Owner Password Flow is used to obtain access tokens for users who have already provided credentials, typically using web form form. It's the recommended flow for highly-trusted apps. It's also used to obtain access tokens for first-party apps.
