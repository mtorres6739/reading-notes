## Questions

1. **What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?**

There are many alternatives to AWS Amplify, including Firebase, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, and many others. These services offer many of the same features as AWS Amplify, such as the ability to build and deploy serverless applications, but they may differ in terms of pricing, available features, and supported programming languages.

One major difference between AWS Amplify and some of its alternatives is that Amplify is specifically designed to work with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Cognito, which can make it easier to build cloud-native applications on the AWS platform. Other services, such as Firebase, may have their own ecosystem of services that work well together, but may not integrate as seamlessly with other cloud platforms.

In terms of trade-offs, one potential disadvantage of using AWS Amplify is that it may be more expensive than some of its alternatives, depending on your specific usage and the services you need. Additionally, Amplify may not be the best choice if you are not already using other AWS services, or if you need to integrate with services outside of the AWS ecosystem.

Overall, the choice of which service to use will depend on your specific needs and requirements. It's always a good idea to compare different options and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.

2. **What AWS Region is closest to you?**

Some of the AWS regions that are closest to Arizona include the US West (Oregon) region, the US West (Northern California) region, and the US East (N. Virginia) region.
