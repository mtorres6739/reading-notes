## Using Images In HTML

1. **What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**

    - Accessibility on webpage is a hot topic right now.  Screen readers are used to aid blind people with reading webpages.  Screen readers use the ```alt``` attribute to read out to the user what the image is about.  Without the ```alt``` tag, or a good description, the user will not know whast the image is about.

2. **How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**

    - You can set a descriptive ```alt``` attribute, a ```title``` and define the ```width``` and ```height.```
  
3. **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**

    - Expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.
    - Could go in several places in the page's linear flow.
    - Provides essential information supporting the main text.

4. **Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

    - ```gif``` is a good option for images that are small and basic.
    - ```svg``` is a type of image that doesn't lose its clarity the larger you expand it. It's best for a lot of print work because it can be easily manipulated and not become grainy.
  
5. **What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

    - ```png``` is going to be the best choice. Text easily becomes fuzzy and unclear under lossy compression.

## Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1. **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**

    - Foreground colors are going to be the color of the elements on the page, that are not part of the background.  So, this will be things like headers, boxes, fonts, etc.  The background color is going to be the color of the page, or the background that all of the elements are on top of.

2. **Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

    - I would give the background some color, and then give some of his text some color.  Maybe the headlines, or sub headlines.  I would also change the color of his links and maybe even give some color to some boxes.  Like if he article titles in div tags that made them look like cards.  I might give the page background a light gray color, and make the background of the cards white, so they look like little title cards floating on the page.

3. **What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

    - You need to make sure that they are not going to be distrating to the reader.  You need to make sure thay are not too tighly spaced, and preferably a sans serif type font.  San serif is preferred since it's easier on the eyes.  You also want to consider the boldness, and also if it's a really "busy" font or not.  Something too busy will turn people off and not want to read the content if its used for block content, instead of a title that is maybe one or two words.

4. **What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**

    - The ```font-size``` element is going to change the size of the font. Either make is smaller or bigger.
    - The ```font-style``` element is going to determine if its italic or not.
    - The ```font-weight``` eleent is going to determine if its bold, not bold, or thin.

5. **Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**

    - You can adjust the ```letter-spacing``` and ```word-spacing``` to get more space around the text.
