## Reading for class 12

This topic is important because there are times where presenting data is a visually appealing manner is going to be a critical part of a particular project.  Rendering important data to users in a way that can capture their attention and keep them on the page is going to be important.  Understanding these topics will allow us to better development these kinds of applications.

## JavaScript Canvas

1. **What does the ```<canvas>``` allow a developer to acheive?**

    - Allows you to draw 2D graphics using javascript.

2. **What is the importance of the closing ```</canvas>``` tag?**

    - Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn't support this element.  This is why the closing element is important.  Without the closing element, the fallback content will not display.

3. **Explain what the ```getContext()``` method does.**

    - This renders a context object.  This element takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the ```CanvasRenderingContext2D``` interface.
