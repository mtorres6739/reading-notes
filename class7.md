# Class 7 Reading Notes

_This class focused on Programming with JavaScript._
  ***

- **Control Flow**
  - We learned that code in run in order from the very first line at the top to the very last lane at the bottom.  In between there are different conditionals and loops in the structure, these are if…else statements.

- **Functions**
  - We learned that functions are basically the building blocks in JavaScript. It’s basically like a procedure or set of instructions to do something. It’s a snippet of code you can run multiple times.  You can use it to isolate a piece of code. It lets us write DRY code so we don’t repeat ourselves.

> function nameofFunctionHere (parameters go here){code goes here}

- Functions will have a return statement, but it is not required.
- In order to use a function you need to invoke it, or call it.  Will call the function by its name.
- Declare the function

```text
function getName(){
Cont usersName = prompt(“What is your name?”); 
Return usersName;
}
```

- Invoking the function (Call the function)

```text
getName();
```

- Can only return one thing in a function and it has to be the last thing in the function

```text
if (whatever in here is true){execute this code}
```

```text
function doThatThing(){
 Let response = prompt(“Do you like JavaScript?”);
 If (response == “no”){
 alert(“That’s wrong”);
 doThatThing();
     }
} 
```
