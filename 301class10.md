## Reading for class 10

This topic is important because we are going to come across errors and we need to know how to handle them. We will also need to know how to debug our code. Understanding the different error codes will help us to understand what is going on with our code.  Also having a good understanding of the callstack will help when we are trying to debug our code.

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. **What is a ‘call’?**

    - A call is when a function is invoked.

2. **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

    - Only one call can happen at a time.

3. **What does LIFO mean?**

    - LIFO means Last In First Out.

4. **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

    - The call stack would look like this:

        - `console.log('1');`
        - `console.log('2');`
        - `console.log('3');`

5. **What causes a Stack Overflow?**

    - A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## JavaScript error messages

1. **What is a ‘reference error’?**

      - A reference error is when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared. You get this type of error when you try to use a variable that is not declared.

2. **What is a ‘syntax error’?**

    - A syntax error is when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax. For example, when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

3. **What is a ‘range error’?**

    - A range error is when you try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length. An example would be when you try to access an element in an array with an index that is out of bounds.

4. **What is a ‘type error’?**

    - A type error is when the types (number, string, etc.) you are trying to use or access are incompatible.

5. **What is a breakpoint?**

    - A breakpoint is a point in your code where you can pause execution and inspect the values that are stored in variables. You can also comb through your code one line at a time.

6. **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

    - The word 'debugger' is used to create a breakpoint in your code. It is used to pause the execution of a script and calls any functions that have been set as breakpoints for the current execution state.
