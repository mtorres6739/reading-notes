# Growth Mindset

## My Growth Mindset

I am always on a quest to learn something new and more of what I already think I know.  I always find there is more to understand.  I also don't give up until I understand something and I love it when I finally figure something out and it just works.  I also like to work with other people and bounce ideas off eachother.  When I'm in a team, for some reason, thinks seem to happen quicker when you have multiple minds thinking out loud.

### 3 reminders for growth mindset:

* I am not going to know everything, but I can try to learn as much as I can.
* Beleive in yourself and great things will happen.
* Ask for help - no shame in getting help! (don't be stubborn, Mathew)
