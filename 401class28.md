## Questions

1. **What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?**

- A RecyclerView is dynamic because it can be used to display a large amount of data without having to load all of it at once. It also allows for the data to be updated without having to reload the entire list. This is done by only loading the data that is currently visible on the screen. This is done by using a ViewHolder object to hold the data for each item in the list. The ViewHolder object is then used to display the data for each item in the list.

2. **Share a screenshot of a recycler view in an application you use!**
