### What is the difference between GPS and Location Services?

GPS is a system of satellites, tracking stations, and receivers that allows a device to determine its precise location on Earth. Location services are a set of technologies that allow a device to determine its location. Location services can use GPS, Wi-Fi, cell towers, and other sensors to determine a device's location.  

### Get the last known location

The last known location is the most recent location that the device has determined. The last known location is not necessarily the current location of the device. The last known location is often used as a starting point for determining the current location of the device.
