## Implicit Intents To And From Your Application

### What is an Intent Filter?

An intent filter is a description of an intent that the component would like to receive. It is a declaration in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the app that the component would like to receive certain intents. The intent filter is a mechanism for one component to express the types of intents that it would like to receive. It is a way for one component to tell the Android system what it can do and what it is willing to accept when other components send it an intent.

### Implicit vs. Explicit Intents

An implicit intent is an intent that does not specify the component to receive the intent. Instead, the intent specifies an action to perform, data to operate on, and/or a category of data. The intent is delivered to a component that can handle it.

An explicit intent is an intent that specifies the component to receive the intent. The intent is delivered to the specified component.
