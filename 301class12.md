## Reading for class 12

This topic is important because understanding CRUD is important for understanding how to create a database and how to interact with it. They are very similar to the HTTP verbs that we have been using in our code. A strong grasp on both of these verbs is going to make it easier to know how to interact with a database.  Databases are a staple in the world of web development and it's crucial we know how to build, maintain and interact with them.

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

1. **In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

    - 100’s = Used to indicate the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.
    - 200’s = Used to indicate the request was received, understood, and accepted.
    - 300’s = Used to indicate the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.
    - 400’s = Used to indicate the client’s request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
    - 500’s = Used to indicate the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

2. **What is a status code 202?**

    - Accepted - The request has been accepted, but  processing has not been completed yet.

3. **What is a status code 308?**

    - Permanent Redirect - The request, and all future requests should be repeated using another URI.

4. **What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**

     - 204 No Content - The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

5. **What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**

     - 410 Gone - The requested resource is no longer available and will not be available again.

6. **What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?**

    - 403 Forbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes

1. **Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?**

    - To keep sensitive information out of the code.

2. **What is middleware?**

    - Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. It's the glue that helps tie together different applications.

3. **What does app.use(express.json()) do?**

    - It allows us to parse JSON. It's a method in express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.

4. **What does the /:id mean in a route?**

    - It's a parameter. It's a placeholder that will be filled in with a value when the route is requested.

5. **What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?**

    - PUT is used to update a resource. PATCH is used to update a resource partially. PUT is idempotent. PATCH is not idempotent. (Indepotent means that the operation can be repeated multiple times without changing the result).

6. **How do you make a default value in a schema?**

     - You can use the default property. For example, `default: false`.

7. **What does a 500 error status code mean?**

    - Internal Server Error - The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.

8. **What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?**

    - 200 OK - The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
    - 201 Created - The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.
