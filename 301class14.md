## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    - More personal computers started appearing in homes across the US.  They were being advertised to primarily males.  This influenced more males to use computers and that began the stereo type of geeky males using computers.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    - This meant that males had a much longer exposure to computers and gained more experience with them.  Since females were not exposed to computers as much, they were less likely to pursue a career in computer science.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

### Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    - When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders.  When leaders understand why diversity matters, they are more likely to make it a priority.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    - Diverse companies perform better because they are able to see problems from different perspectives.  This allows them to come up with more creative solutions to problems.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    - A diverse company can serve a diverse user base because they are able to see problems from different perspectives.  This allows them to come up with more creative solutions to problems. A diverse user base can help a company be more diverse because they can provide feedback on how to make the product more inclusive.
