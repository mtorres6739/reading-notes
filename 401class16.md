## Authentication With Spring Security

[Home](https://mtorres6739.github.io/reading-notes/)

## Spring Security Architecture

- Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. It is the de facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

- Spring Security is built on Servlet Filters. It is a chain of filters that are applied to a request. The filters are applied in the order that they are defined.

- The first filter in the chain is the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`. This filter is responsible for processing an authentication form. It is also responsible for validating the username and password.

- The second filter in the chain is the `BasicAuthenticationFilter`. This filter is responsible for processing basic authentication.

- The third filter in the chain is the `DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter`. This filter is responsible for generating the login page.

- The fourth filter in the chain is the `DefaultLogoutPageGeneratingFilter`. This filter is responsible for generating the logout page.

- The fifth filter in the chain is the `RequestCacheAwareFilter`. This filter is responsible for saving the current request before redirecting to the login page.

- The sixth filter in the chain is the `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter`. This filter is responsible for maintaining the `SecurityContext` between requests.

- The seventh filter in the chain is the `HeaderWriterFilter`. This filter is responsible for writing headers to the response.

- The eighth filter in the chain is the `CsrfFilter`. This filter is responsible for protecting against CSRF attacks.

- The ninth filter in the chain is the `LogoutFilter`. This filter is responsible for processing logouts.

- The tenth filter in the chain is the `AnonymousAuthenticationFilter`. This filter is responsible for processing anonymous requests.

- The eleventh filter in the chain is the `SessionManagementFilter`. This filter is responsible for managing the `HttpSession`.

- The twelfth filter in the chain is the `ExceptionTranslationFilter`. This filter is responsible for translating any `AuthenticationException` into a `Spring Security` specific response.

- The thirteenth filter in the chain is the `FilterSecurityInterceptor`. This filter is responsible for enforcing any configured security constraints.
