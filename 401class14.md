## Hashing Passwords: One-Way Road to Security

- Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted. Hashing is a one-way process. The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password is hashed and compared to the hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. If the hashes do not match, the user is not authenticated.

### What's Hashing About?

- Hashing is a one-way process. The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password is hashed and compared to the hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. If the hashes do not match, the user is not authenticated.

### Salting

- Salting is adding random data to the password before hashing. Salting the password makes it harder to crack. Salting the password makes it harder to crack.

## What is Bcrypt?

- Bcrypt is a password hashing function. It is based on the Blowfish cipher and can be used to hash passwords. It is a one-way process. The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password is hashed and compared to the hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. If the hashes do not match, the user is not authenticated.

### How Does Bcrypt Work?

- Bcrypt uses a key derivation function. It is based on the Blowfish cipher. It is a one-way process. The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password is hashed and compared to the hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. If the hashes do not match, the user is not authenticated.

## What is jBCrypt?

- jBCrypt is a Java implementation of the OpenBSD Blowfish password hashing code. It is a one-way process. The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password is hashed and compared to the hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. If the hashes do not match, the user is not authenticated.
