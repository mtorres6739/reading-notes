### Baeldung: Comparing repositories (we’ll be using JpaRepository)

- Spring Data JPA provides a repository abstraction that allows you to define interfaces that extend the Repository interface.

#### JPA Repository

- JpaRepository is a subinterface of Repository.
- JpaRepository provides CRUD methods out of the box.
- JpaRepository is a marker interface.
- JpaRepository is parameterized with two types: the domain type and the id type.

#### JPA Repository Methods

- JpaRepository provides CRUD methods out of the box.
- JpaRepository provides methods to delete entities in bulk.
- JpaRepository provides methods to flush changes to the database.
- JpaRepository provides methods to save multiple entities at once.
- JpaRepository provides methods to retrieve entities by their id.
- JpaRepository provides methods to sort entities.
- JpaRepository provides methods to retrieve entities using pagination.

- findAll() - get a list of all available entities in database
- findAll(...) - get a list of all available entities and sort them using the provided condition
- findById() - get an entity by id
- save() - save an entity to the database
- save(...) - save an iterable of entities. Pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
- saveAndFlush(...) - save an entity and flush changes instantly
