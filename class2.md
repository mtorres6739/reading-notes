# Class 2 Reading Notes

_This class focused on the proper setup of our machines to provide an efficient coding environment. It involved downloading the correct applications and understanding how to use the command line terminal_

- **The Coder's Computer**
   
  - Programs installed via the command terminal include:
     - Homebrew
     - git
     - node
     - live server
     - eslint
     - tree
     - zsh
     - VS code
 
   - Text Editors vs Code-Specific Editors vs IDE (Integrated Development Environment
     - Text Editors
       - Basic text editors are going to be simple applications that purely edit text without any other formatting.  This will be programs like text editor for max or notepad for windows.  In these programs there is none special characteristis to the format of the text.
     - Code-Specific Editors
       - Code-specific editors, like VS code, are going to provide specific functionality for making it easier to write code.  For example, some systax will auto-populate and auto-complete when writing the first few characters of code. When opening a bracket, there will be an automatic closed bracket created.  There will also be color codes added to your text to indicate certain functions and other rules. There is also indicators that show any potential problems in coding syntax and provide possible solutions. Overall, a coding-specufic platform like VS code is significantly more efficient than a basic text editor that has none of the features mentioned. Also worth noting, there are a multitude of code-specific editors other than VS code, such as Brackets, Atom, Sublime Text, BB Edit, Notepad++ etc.
     - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
        - an IDE is going to be an all-in-one software package that will allow you write code as well complie and/or debug.  This is going to be a more intensive and full featured program. Think Microsoft Outlook where it contains an email client, a calendar, a task manager and a to-do-list all in one software application.  
   
   - The Command Line Terminal
      - We learned the basic commands of the command line terminal so that we may be able to create and name directories, move around the differnt folders, create files and install programs. 
      - Basic Commands
        - **pwd** (_print working directory_)
        - **ls** (_list the contents of the directory/folder_)
        - **cd** (_move to a new folder/change directory_)
        - **mkdir** (_make a new directory/folder_)
        - **clear** (_clear out the terminal_)
        - **touch** (_create a file_)
        - **code .** (_open up VS code from terminal_)
        - **cd ..** (_go back in the directory - the number of dots equals the number of directories to go back_)
        - **tree** (_see a visual representation of all the directories and files_)
