## Questions

1. **What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?**

- Room is wrapped around the SQLite database engine. I think this is a good choice because SQLite is a lightweight database engine that is easy to use and is built into Android. It is also a good choice because it is open source and free to use.

2. **Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?**

- Rooms have some similarities to JPA. They both use annotations to define the database schema. They also both use the DAO pattern to access the database. However, Rooms are more lightweight than JPA. They are also more efficient because they use the SQLite database engine.

3. **Describe a DAO in your own words**

- A DAO is a Data Access Object. It is an interface that contains methods that are used to access the database. The methods are annotated with SQL queries that are used to access the database.
