## Reading for class 1

1. **What does “strong typed” mean?**

    - Strongly typed means that the language has a strict definition of the data types and operations that can be applied to variables. This means that the compiler will check types and throw errors if incompatible types are used in an operation. This is in contrast to weakly typed languages, where the compiler will try to make sense of the operation and may produce unexpected results. Java is a strongly typed language.

2. **Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.**

    - In Java, the code is compiled into bytecode, which is then run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In JavaScript, the code is compiled into machine code, which is then run by the browser.
