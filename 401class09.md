### High-Level HTTP

HTTP is a protocol that allows for the exchange of data between a client and a server. It is a request-response protocol, which means that the client sends a request to the server and the server sends a response back to the client. The client and server communicate using a request method, which indicates the desired action to be performed on the identified resource, and a status code, which indicates whether the request has been successfully completed.

### Java HTTP Request Methods

The HTTP protocol defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.
