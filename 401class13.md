### One-To-Many/Many-To-One Relationships

- One-to-many relationships are relationships where one entity can be related to many other entities. For example, a person can have many pets, but a pet can only have one owner. In this case, the person is the one entity and the pet is the many entity. The relationship between the two is one-to-many.

- Many-to-one relationships are relationships where many entities can be related to one other entity. For example, a person can have many pets, but a pet can only have one owner. In this case, the person is the one entity and the pet is the many entity. The relationship between the two is many-to-one.

### Testing With JUnit and Hamcrest

- JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.

- Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. It is an alternative to JUnit's assertion library. Hamcrest is a library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) that are used to write assertions in tests. It is an alternative to JUnit's assertion library.
