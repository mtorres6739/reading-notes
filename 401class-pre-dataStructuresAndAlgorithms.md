1. **What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

    - The time and space complexity of the data structure.  You want to choose the data structure that will be the most efficient in terms of time and space.

2. **How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

    - We can ensure that we avoid an infinite recursive call stack by making sure that the base case is met.  If the base case is not met, then the function will continue to call itself until the stack is full.
