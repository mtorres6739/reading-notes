### Don't Repeat Yourself

DRY is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

### Rule of Three

The Rule of Three is a design guideline that states that a class should have only two instances of identical code. If there are three instances of identical code, then it should be refactored into a new method.

### You Aren't Gonna Need It

YAGNI is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

### Minimum Viable Product

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.
