## Spring Boot and OAuth2

- Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

- Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of building production-ready applications. Spring Boot favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

- Spring Boot favors convention over configuration. It is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration of Spring.

- Spring Boot automatically configures Spring whenever possible. For example, if Spring MVC is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.

## OAuth2

- OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean.

- OAuth2 is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their password.
