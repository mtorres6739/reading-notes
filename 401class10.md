### Stacks and Queues

#### Stacks

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.


#### Common terminology for a stack is

- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

#### Common terminology for a queue is

- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

#### What is a Queue

A queue is a FIFO (First-in, First-out) data structure. This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

#### What is a Stack

A stack is a LIFO (Last-in, First-out) data structure. This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

#### What is a Node

Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a stack. Each node contains the data for each link.

#### What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

#### LIFO

Last In First Out.

#### FILO

First In Last Out
