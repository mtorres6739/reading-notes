### Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency 

- Big O notation is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 
- Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
- Big O is commonly used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
