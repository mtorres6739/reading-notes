## About Me

_My name is Mathew Torres and love sci-fi!_

Hi, my name is Mathew Torres (he/him) and I live in Phoenix, AZ.  Arizona is weird when it comes to time zones.  We associate with Mountain Standard Time, but since we don't follow daylight savings time, our time is the same as pacific during daylight savings time.

I am in the Army National Guard and serve as a public affairs officer. We do a lot of video production, article writing and working with civilian media channels. I originally enlisted in 2011 as a human resources specialist doing admin work. in 2015, I went through ROTC at Arizona State and commissioned as a signal officer where I managed teams that set up big satellites in the desert.

My civilian career has primarily been in sales and marketing.  I was most recently working in insurance and real estate. For a while I sold employee benefits to insurance brokers and then most recently I was a buyer and tenant rep for medical professionals helping them with their commercial real estate.> I'm currently running on macOS Monterey version 12.5,

Turns out I don't really enjoy sales.  I found myself spending all my time after work, and some during work, doing web stuff. I've dabbled with web development since I was in high school, way back in 99, but never really made a push to make it a career, until now.  I'm really excited to go all in and make a life change with tech.
