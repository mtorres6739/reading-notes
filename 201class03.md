## Reading for class 3

The topics covered in this class are important because they further enhance the user experience in web development.

Ordered and unordered lists are used quite often when creating menus and segmenting out different types of data so that they can be digested easier by the user.

Understanding the box model is also critical because most all web pages utilize this method. Having a strong grasp of how things like margin and padding work will greatly improve our understanding of proper web page structure when we create our own projects.

JavaScript is very complex and has many different aspects to it. It is also the main way web pages create user interaction. Understanding these basic concepts like conditionals and loops will help us understand the behavior of our code as we go further in learning JavaScript.

## Learn HTML

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

1. **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

    - You would ue an unordered list when the list is meaningless and changing the order would not have any impact on the items.

2. **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

    - You would change the attribute using a list-style-type in css.
    - Example:

    ```css
      /* Partial list of types */
      list-style-type: disc;
      list-style-type: circle;
      list-style-type: square;
      list-style-type: decimal;
      list-style-type: georgian;
      list-style-type: trad-chinese-informal;
      list-style-type: kannada;
      ```

3. **When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**

    - you should use on ordered list when the order of the items matters. For example, if using it for steps in a recipe, the order matters.  If using it for turn by turn directions, the order matters.

4. **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

    - You can use the ```type``` attribute to change the type of number. For example, you can change the number to capital/lowercase roman numbers, or capital/lowercase letters/numbers.

    - You can use the ```start``` attribute to start at a different number.  For example, start at number 4 instead of number 1.

## Learn CSS

### The Box Model

1. **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

    - The margin is all the space outside of the box, and the padding is all the space inside of the block.  The margin outside of the block will push everthing away from the block.

2. **List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**

    - The four parts of an HTML elements box are:
      - Content box - This is where your content is displayed.
      - Padding Box - Padding around the content, but within the box.
      - Border Box - The border around the box.
      - Margin Box - The space outside of the box

## Learn JS

### Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. **What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

    - Strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays

2. **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

    - Yes, it's valid. use ```people[1][2][3]```

```js
// given example (incorrect)
 const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

```

3. **List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

    - Addition: ```x += f()``` means ```x = x + f()```
      - Adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable
    - Subtraction: ```x -= f()``` means ```x = x - f()```
      - Subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable
    - Multiplication: ```x *= f()``` means ```x = x * f()```
      - Multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable
    - Division: ```x /= f()``` means ```x = x / f()```
      - Divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable
    - Remainder: ```x %= f()``` means ```x = x % f()```
      - Divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the remainder to the variable

4. **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

    - It would add to 10dog. A false would give a value of 0. 10+ 0 + dog = 10dog.

      ```js

      let a = 10;
      let b = 'dog';
      let c = false;

      // evaluate this
      (a + c) + b;

      ```

5. **Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

    - A real world example would be, if I asked a user for a password to a website, I could grant them access if they entered the correct password.  Else, I could show them a "restricted access" message on a page if they did not give the correct password.

6. **Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

    - You could use a loop to keep repeating a peice of code or promot until the user gives you a correct answer, or the answer you are looking for.
