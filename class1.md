# Class 1 Reading Notes

_This class stressed the importance of setting up our accounts and ensure the profiles matched from profile to profile._

- **Setting up Accounts**
  - CANVAS
    - Leanred that this is the main learning management system where all the content and course materials will be stored.
  - REMO
    - This is the collaborative lab environment where you can break out into small groups, virtually.  Here you are able to chat with small teams and work on projects.  Instructors are also able to screen share and troubleshoot any issues you might have.
  - Slack
    - Slack is the main communication platform that the entire class can utilize to collaborate and ask questions.  It's connected to the entire school, not just your classroom.  This is great if you want to connect with other students and instructors outside of the normal class hours.
  - GitHub
    - This is the main online platform that will house all of our respositories and will eventually be a showcase of our work for future employers to view.  This is going to be an evolving profile that will grow with us as our skills develop.

- **Learning Markdown**
  - This is another language that creates webpages similar to HTML.  It is easier than HTML as most of the syntax is more simplified and you can accomplish the same thing as HTML but with less syntax.
