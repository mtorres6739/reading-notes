## Questions

1. **What makes an API RESTful?**

    - RESTful APIs are designed around a **resources**. These resources are accessed using **HTTP** methods. The most common HTTP methods are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**. These methods are used to perform CRUD operations on the resources. The API should be designed in a way that it is easy to understand and use.  It is restful because it is a standard way to access resources.

2. **What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?**

    - The benefit of using GraphQL is that it allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs. This is a huge benefit because it allows the client to only request the data it needs. This can save a lot of bandwidth and time. The downside is that it can be more difficult to implement and maintain.
    - The downside to using GraphQL is that it can be more difficult to implement and maintain. It can also be more difficult to debug. It is also more difficult to implement security caching.

3. **Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.**

    - Serverless means that the server is managed by a third party and not the the developer. The developer does not have to worry about the server and can focus on the application.
