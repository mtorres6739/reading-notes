## Hash Tables

1. **What is a Hash Table?**

   - A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values.  A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. 

2. **Why do we use them?**

   - We use them because they are fast.  They are fast because they are able to find the value in the hash table in O(1) time.  This is because the hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

3. **What are the advantages of a Hash Table over an array?**

   - The advantages of a hash table over an array are that they are fast, they are flexible, and they are easy to implement. They are fast because they are able to find the value in the hash table in O(1) time.  They are flexible because they can grow and shrink as needed.

5. **How is a Hash Table implemented?**

   - A hash table is implemented by using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. 
   - The hash function is used to map the key to an integer in the range of array indices.  
   - The integer is then used as the index to look up the value in the array. The hash function is used to map the key to an integer in the range of array indices.  The integer is then used as the index to look up the value in the array. 

6. **What are the steps of implementing a Hash Table?**

   - The steps of implementing a hash table are to: 
     - Hash the key
     - Use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
     - Store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

  The hash function is used to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.  The hash table is the array of buckets or slots.  The values are added to the hash table by using the hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
