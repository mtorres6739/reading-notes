## Ethics

### Code of Ethics

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is a set of guidelines for ethical behavior in the field of computer science and information technology. It was developed by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a leading professional organization for computing professionals.

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct consists of eight general principles, which are intended to provide guidance for ethical decision-making in the field of computing. 

These principles include:

Public: Computing professionals should act for the public good.
Client and employer: Computing professionals should act with integrity and responsibility towards clients and employers.

Product: Computing professionals should ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

Judgment: Computing professionals should maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

Management: Computing professionals should manage their work responsibly.

Profession: Computing professionals should advance the integrity and 
reputation of the profession.

Colleagues: Computing professionals should respect the proprietary rights of others.

Self: Computing professionals should be honest and fair in all professional relationships.

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is intended to serve as a reference for computing professionals to help them make ethical decisions and act with integrity in their professional lives. It is not a legally binding document, but it is widely accepted as a standard for ethical behavior in the field of computing.

### Ethics in the workplace

As software developers, it is important to uphold ethical standards in the workplace and in the development of software products. This includes being honest and transparent in communication and decision-making, treating colleagues and clients with respect and fairness, and being responsible for the quality and safety of the software being developed.

Developers have a significant amount of power and influence over the products they create and the systems they build, and with this power comes a responsibility to consider the potential impacts and consequences of their work. This can include considering the ethical implications of the software, such as how it may be used and by whom, and ensuring that the software is developed in a way that is secure and respects the privacy and rights of users.

Developers also have a responsibility to continue learning and staying up to date with the latest best practices and standards in the field, including ethical considerations. This can help to ensure that they are creating high-quality, reliable, and ethical software products that meet the needs and expectations of users.

### Ethics in Technology

Ethics in technology refers to the principles and values that guide the development and use of technology in a way that is responsible, respectful, and fair. As technology continues to advance and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is important to consider the ethical implications of this development and use.

Big tech leaders play a significant role in shaping the technological landscape and have a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of their products and practices. This can include considering issues such as data privacy and security, user experience, and the potential impacts of technology on society and the environment.

In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny and debate over the ethical responsibilities of big tech companies, particularly in regards to their handling of personal data and their influence on society and the economy. Some experts have called for greater regulation and oversight of these companies to ensure that they are acting in an ethical and responsible manner. Others have argued that tech leaders have a responsibility to self-regulate and take proactive steps to address ethical concerns on their own.

### Tech Company Principles

Tech companies often establish principles to guide the development and use of their technology, including principles related to artificial intelligence (AI) and ethical considerations. These principles can help to ensure that the technology is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner, and can serve as a reference for employees and stakeholders to understand the company's values and expectations.

One example of tech company principles is Microsoft's AI principles, which outline the company's commitments to responsible development and use of AI. These principles include transparency, fairness, accountability, inclusivity, and reliability, and are intended to guide the company's development of AI products and services.

The Ethical OS toolkit is another example of a resource for tech companies and individuals to consider ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. This toolkit provides a framework and resources for identifying and addressing ethical concerns in technology, and can be used by companies to develop their own ethical guidelines or principles.

Google has also established AI principles to guide the development and use of AI at the company. These principles include being socially beneficial, avoiding creating or reinforcing unfair bias, being transparent and accountable, and incorporating privacy and security by design. These principles are intended to help ensure that Google's AI products and services are developed and used in a way that is responsible and ethical.
