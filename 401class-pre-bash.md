## Summary

During this prework assignment I learned how to use the BASH terminal. I learned how to navigate through the terminal and how to use commands to navigate and manipulate files and directories.

### The Command Line

The command line allows you to interact with the computer in a text based manner as opposed to the normal graphical user interface.  This allows some greater control and manipulation through the use of specific commands entered into the terminal.  The command line is a very powerful tool that can be used to do a lot of things.  It is important to understand how to use the command line and how to navigate through it.

### Basic Navigation

A couple pretty common commands to move around the terminal are ```ls``` and ```pwd```.  When ls is used, it allows to you to see a listing of all your files, and pwd is used to show you the file path to the current directory you are in.  You can then ues commands like ```cd``` to change directories.

### More About Files

It was interesting to note that with linux, everything is a file, even directories. I did not know that you could use the \ or surround the file in quotes to nullify a space in a file name. I think what I found most interesting is that linux doesn't require a file extension to know what kinda of file it is. It actually goes into the file and looks at the first few bytes to determine what kind of file it is. Very cool.

### Manual Pages

The manual pages are a great way to learn more about the commands you are using.  You can use the ```man``` command to bring up the manual page for a specific command.  You can then use the arrow keys to scroll through the page.  You can also use the ```/``` key to search for a specific term.  You can also use the ```q``` key to quit the manual page.  I had no idea this feature existed so its pretty cool.

### File Manipulation

There are a lot of commands that can be used to manipulate files.  The commands I have used the most are ```touch``` and ```mkdir``` to create files and directories.  I have also used the ```cp``` and ```mv``` commands to copy and move files.  I think what was surprising to me is that you can move a file in the same directory and changes its file name at the same time.  That was a big ah-ha moment for me.

### Cheat Sheet

I found this cheat sheet to be very helpful.  It has a lot of the commands that I have used and it is a good reference to have.  I will be printing this out and keeping it with me.
