## Reading for class 13

This topic is important because CRUD is the foundation of any database.  It's important to understand how to use it and how to implement it in our code. As software developers, we will be working with databases a lot, so it's important to understand how to use them.

## CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

    - PUT or PATCH

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

    - PUT, PATCH, DELETE

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

    - REST is an architectural style for building APIs. CRUD is a set of operations that can be performed on data. CRUD is a subset of REST.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

    - Define the routes and the HTTP methods that will be used.
    - Define the models and schemas for the data you want to store in the database
    - Define the controllers and their methods for each route and model
    - Define the middleware (if needed)
    - Define the database connection and configuration settings (if needed)
