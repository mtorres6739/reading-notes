[Home](https://mtorres6739.github.io/reading-notes/)

## Reading for class 03

This topic is important because there are many times when you will need to pass functions around from one component to another.  Understanding how to do this will greatly improve my comprehension of react applications.

## The Spread Operator

1. **What is the spread operator?**

    - It basically takes an array and spreads it out into its individual elements.  It makes it so you can copy an array without mutating the original array.

2. **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

    - Copy an array.
    - Concatenate arrays.  
    - Use an array as arguments.  
    - Add an item to a list.

3. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**

    - ```let arr1 = ['ford','lexus'','mercedes'];```
    - ```let arr2 = ['kia','hyundai','chevy'];```
    - ```let arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];```

4. **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**

    - ```let arr1 = ['cat','dog','mouse'];```
    - ```let arr2 = [...arr1, 'rat'];```

5. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**

    - ```let obj1 = {name: 'Matt', age: 38};```
    - ```let obj2 = {job: 'software developer'};```
    - ```let obj3 = {...obj1, ...obj2};```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

1. **In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

    - Create a function in the parent component. Where ever the state is that you want to change.

2. **In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

     - It increments the count of something by 1.

3. **How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

    - By passing it as a prop. Then call it in the child component.

4. **How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

    - You call it using props in the child component.
