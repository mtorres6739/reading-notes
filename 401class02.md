## Reading for class 2

1. **Which loops use a loop counter?**

    - For loops use a loop counter

2. **Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.**

    - public static int binarySearch(int[] a, int key) - Searches the specified array of ints for the specified value using the binary search algorithm. The array must be sorted (as by the sort(int[]) method) prior to making this call. If it is not sorted, the results are undefined. If the array contains multiple elements with the specified value, there is no guarantee which one will be found. (from reference: Java Arrays)
    - public static boolean equals(long[] a, long[] a2) - Returns true if the two specified arrays of longs are equal to one another. Two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the same number of elements, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal. This returns true if the two arrays are equal. (from reference: Java Arrays)
    - public static void fill(int[] a, int val) - Assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of ints.
    - public static void sort(int[] a) - Sorts the specified array of ints into ascending numerical order.(from reference: Java Arrays)

3. **Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.**

    -  Built-in packages are like the built-in apps on your phone.  You don't have to download them, they are already there.  Built-in packages are already there in the Java language, you don't need to download them.
