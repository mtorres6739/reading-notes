## Summary

During this pre work assignment I looked at various articles and TED talks that spoke to the importance of a growth mindset. These topics were interesting to learn because it's critical to have a growth mindset as developers.  We will be encountering many problems and we need to maintain the determination and grit to solve them.

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

My observation with this article is that finding challenges as a developer after you have been at the job for a while can be difficult.  It seems that most of the day job is doing the same thing every day, and you might need to look outside of the job to find ways to expand your knowledge and push yourself.  Finding new things to learn and challenges to tackle can be difficult, but its crucial to keep growing as a developer.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

Carol Dweck spoke about growth mindset and how it can be applied to learning.  She spoke about how people with a growth mindset are more likely to be successful in life.  She also spoke about how people with a fixed mindset are more likely to give up when they face challenges.  I think that this is a very important topic to understand, considering that we are going to be facing lots of challenges as software developers, we need to be able to push through them and learn from them.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

In this TED talk, Angela Lee Duckworth spoke about grit.  She spoke about how grit is more important than IQ when it comes to success.  She also spoke about how grit can be learned and how it can be applied to learning.  I think that this is a very important topic to understand, considering that we are going to be facing lots of challenges as software developers, we need to be able to push through them and learn from them.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

In this TED talk, Alain de Botton spoke about how we define success.  He spoke about how we need to redefine success to be more than just money and power.  He also spoke about how we need to redefine success to be more about happiness and fulfillment.  He mentioned not too long ago we stated someone who was not successful was just unfortunate, now we say they are a loser.

## Emotional Intelligence Survey

After taking the emotional intelligence survey, I scored 25 in Self-Awareness, and 24 each in Self-Management, Social Awareness and Relationship Management.  As I was answering the questions, I found that I have always had this natural inclination to do most, if not, all of these questions.  I have always been someone who was able to “read” people and gauge their emotional state.  Once I understood how the other person was feeling, I tailored my communication style to mirror how they were feeling. I used to feel like I was a fraud because I was always acting like a chameleon and conforming to others, but after researching emotional intelligence further, I found it was actually a skill.

## Assessing Bias

After taking the Bias Self Assessment from Code 201, I initially wasn't sure what I think about the assessment.  My strongest area was Meaningful Connections.  My weakest area was Bias and Identity. During Code 301 I feel I have increased my awareness of Bias and Identity while working with multiple people in various groups.
